# Platform Interop

This package keeps the scientific logic in one place and treats platform features as optional accelerators.

## Core Rule

The skill must still work when all you have is shell plus file access. Richer platform features are helpers, not dependencies.

## Integrated Planning Artifact

Across Codex, Clouds_Coder.py, Claude Code, and OpenCode, the portable planning artifact is the same project-relative Markdown file:

```text
workflow/integrated_research_plan.md
```

Create it for research-design work before launch-ready inputs, regardless of whether the selected route is DFT-only or multiscale. It uses only standard Markdown and stable claim/stage IDs, so no platform-specific planner, frontmatter, or tool call is required. Keep its `Control Snapshot` synchronized with the portable manifest and research spine; use the bundled validators from the copied project-local `scripts/` directory.

## Clouds_Coder

Recommended entry:

- use the standard source skill directly for portable full-body loading
- for Clouds compact loading, materialize a copy with `scripts/sync_skill_to_platforms.py --targets clouds --mode copy`; this applies `agents/clouds-coder.json` only to the generated target
- preferred optimized project-local path: `skills/generated/dft-workflow-orchestrator/`
- external-library discovery also works when `DFT_Skills/` is kept adjacent to the active `skills/` directory, because `Clouds_Coder.py` scans sibling directories for `skills/*/SKILL.md`

Preferred accelerators:

- `query_knowledge_library` for local RAG retrieval
- `load_skill` for chaining with research or PDF skills
- online search when local coverage is thin or the theory basis is incomplete

Grounding order on Clouds_Coder.py:

1. uploaded or local project materials
2. local RAG retrieval
3. online search
4. model knowledge as the final fallback

Stop at the first tier that already resolves the theory basis and experiment design.

Fallback:

- search workspace files directly
- use the bundled scripts for preflight, scaffolding, job rendering, and analysis

Native compatibility notes:

- keep the skill itself inside the active `skills_root`, because `Clouds_Coder.py` resolves writes with `safe_path(..., skills_root)`
- keep reusable assets inside the skill bundle only
- keep generated calculation work outside the skill bundle, in a user project root such as `project/workflow`, `project/structures`, `project/runs`, and `project/analysis`
- do not write run outputs, logs, or relaxed structures back into the skill directory during normal execution
- keep `SKILL.md` standard and preserve `clouds_coder.preferred_tools`, `entrypoints`, and `runtime_contract` in `agents/clouds-coder.json`; the sync script renders them into the Clouds copy
- preserve enough body detail that `load_skill` enters compact-mode loading, so the runtime shows the contract plus resource manifest first and deeper files stay on demand
- use `query_knowledge_library` proactively on theory-heavy tasks, but only after uploaded and local materials have been checked first
- keep front-end monitoring alive with `scripts/monitor_vasp_runs.py` when queues are running in the background

Validation helper:

- run `python3 scripts/verify_clouds_compat.py` from the skill directory to check the standard source, overlay entrypoints, rendered copy, and compact-mode behavior when `Clouds_Coder` is importable

## Claude Code

Supported local skill paths:

1. project local: `.claude/skills/dft-workflow-orchestrator/SKILL.md`
2. user level: `~/.claude/skills/dft-workflow-orchestrator/SKILL.md`

The local path is the safest default because the bundled scripts remain close to the working repository.
When Claude Code has web-capable tooling available, use uploaded files and local literature first, then web retrieval, then model prior. Stop when the current tier is already sufficient.

## OpenCode

OpenCode recognizes several routes:

1. project local: `.opencode/skills/dft-workflow-orchestrator/SKILL.md`
2. user level: `~/.config/opencode/skills/dft-workflow-orchestrator/SKILL.md`
3. Claude-compatible skill paths
4. Agent-standard paths under `.agents/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/`

That means one copied bundle can serve both OpenCode and Claude-compatible loaders.
On OpenCode, prioritize uploaded or local sources first; use web retrieval when available; then use model knowledge with explicit uncertainty tags. Stop when the current tier is already sufficient.

## Codex

Portable contract:

- standard `SKILL.md`
- optional `agents/openai.yaml` UI metadata

Local install targets vary by Codex surface, so the sync script supports both:

1. `~/.codex/skills/dft-workflow-orchestrator/`
2. `~/.agents/skills/dft-workflow-orchestrator/`

If you do not know which surface is active, install both.
On Codex surfaces without a dedicated RAG tool, emulate the same policy with local files plus web retrieval before relying on model memory, and stop the collection chain once the current tier is sufficient.

## Portability Rules

- keep standard `SKILL.md` frontmatter limited to `name` and `description`
- keep platform-specific enhancement fields in sidecar overlays, not in the portable source frontmatter
- keep reusable automation in `scripts/`
- keep long methodology in `references/`
- never require proprietary platform-only tool names to complete the workflow
- prefer copied bundles over fragile fixed-path assumptions when distributing the skill
