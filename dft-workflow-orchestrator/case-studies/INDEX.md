# Case Study Index

This folder contains reusable engineering case templates for the DFT workflow skill. Each case is meant to be a working planning packet, not a one-line reminder. Open one case first, extract the relevant workflow logic, and only combine cases when the science question genuinely spans two domains.

## What Each Case Now Provides

Each case file is expected to give:

- the engineering intent and the decision boundary for when that case is the right one
- the theory and modeling boundary, including what plain DFT can support and what must remain qualified
- the minimum information that should be collected before job launch
- a structure-model strategy, not just a property name
- a recommended job ladder so the workflow can be materialized into `workflow/experiment_matrix.csv`
- the primary outputs, controls, sensitivity axes, and analysis checks
- common failure modes, escalation triggers, and cross-case handoff guidance

## How To Use This Folder

1. Match the user's decisive observable, not the most attractive figure type.
2. Open only the single most relevant case file first.
3. Add a second case only if the workflow truly crosses domains, for example interface plus optics, or DFT plus COMSOL handoff.
4. Translate the chosen case first into `workflow/integrated_research_plan.md`, then into `workflow/request_summary.md`, `workflow/theory_packet.md`, `workflow/claim_matrix.md`, and `workflow/experiment_matrix.csv`.
5. Keep all generated structures, runs, and analysis in the project root rather than inside the skill bundle.

## Selection Rules

- If the user asks for a mechanism, start from the case tied to the decisive observable, not from the visually richest plot.
- If the user asks for several properties at once, separate the bootstrap case from the downstream cases instead of merging every target into one launch packet.
- If the user asks for continuum, reactor, or long-time behavior, first finish the DFT packet, then open the corresponding handoff or scale-bridging case.
- If one case reveals that the current DFT level is insufficient, record the limit explicitly and stop pretending the case file alone resolves the scientific question.
- If the decisive observable is resolved by one case, stop there and record deferred scales in the research spine.
- If several cases are plausible, ask for route, depth, deliverable, and validation preferences before opening a coupled packet.
- Keep branch purpose, stop criteria, and artifact lineage in `workflow/branch_register.csv` and `workflow/data_lineage.csv`.
