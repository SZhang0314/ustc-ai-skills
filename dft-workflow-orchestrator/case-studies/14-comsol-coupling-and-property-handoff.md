# COMSOL And General FEM Property Handoff

## Engineering Intent

Use this case when DFT is supposed to supply constitutive inputs to COMSOL, FEniCSx, MOOSE, Abaqus, CalculiX, or another continuum multiphysics model. The workflow should identify exactly which properties are needed, compute only defensible upstream quantities, and then package them with units, basis conventions, validity windows, and caveats.

Do not pass raw DFT outputs straight into a continuum solver without documenting the interpretation layer.

Read `references/fem-multiscale-coupling.md` for governing-equation specification, tensor and unit mapping, solver verification, feedback, and uncertainty propagation.

## Questions This Workflow Must Answer

- Which continuum parameters are actually required: scalar constants, tensors, source terms, or reduced kinetic parameters?
- Which of those quantities are direct DFT outputs and which must be fitted, averaged, or inferred?
- Over what composition, temperature, field, strain, or microstructural window are the parameters valid?
- What assumptions must the downstream COMSOL model preserve so the handoff remains meaningful?

## Theory And Modeling Boundary

- DFT can provide intrinsic crystal-scale properties such as elastic tensors, dielectric tensors, defect formation trends, band-edge proxies, reaction energies, or migration barriers.
- COMSOL usually needs continuum-ready parameters, which often require averaging, constitutive interpretation, or reduced-model fitting beyond raw DFT.
- A DFT quantity computed at one composition or temperature is not automatically a general material constant.
- If the downstream quantity depends on mesoscale geometry, porosity, roughness, or device architecture, that dependence belongs to the continuum model, not the DFT packet.

## Minimum Inputs Before Launch

- the exact downstream physics module or constitutive equation that needs the parameter
- tensor versus scalar requirement and the required coordinate system
- units, sign conventions, and the operating window for temperature, composition, field, or strain
- whether the handoff is meant to be intrinsic, effective-medium, or fitted to experiment using DFT as one constraint
- what uncertainty or sensitivity range the downstream solver can tolerate

## Structure Strategy

- choose the DFT case that produces the needed upstream property instead of launching generic calculations
- keep the structural phase and orientation tied to the specific continuum parameter
- if several phases or states are relevant, create separate handoff branches rather than averaging them informally
- preserve any tensor basis rotation or unit conversion as an explicit workflow step
- when a reduced kinetic model is needed, connect each parameter back to a named DFT observable

## Recommended Job Ladder

1. identify the exact downstream parameter list before any DFT work
2. route each parameter to the correct DFT case or property workflow
3. compute only the upstream observables required for the constitutive mapping
4. post-process units, tensor basis, sign conventions, and any averaging or fitting
5. assemble a handoff table with validity window and uncertainty notes
6. optionally test the handoff logic on a minimal COMSOL-ready input template

## Primary Outputs And Decisions

- handoff table with parameter name, value, units, basis, source jobs, and validity range
- explicit separation between direct DFT outputs and derived constitutive parameters
- uncertainty or sensitivity note for each parameter family
- recommendation on whether the current packet is sufficient for the intended continuum model
- list of upstream quantities that still need refinement before the handoff is safe

## Controls And Sensitivity Axes

- ensure each parameter is computed in the structural phase relevant to the downstream device or reactor state
- keep coordinate-system conventions visible for all tensors
- separate intrinsic, defect-modified, and effective-medium quantities
- if the downstream model requires temperature dependence, document whether the DFT packet provides only a zero-temperature anchor
- do not mix values from incompatible approximations without a clear fitting logic

## Analysis Checklist

- verify every parameter in the handoff table can be traced to a source job or a documented derivation
- state whether each quantity is scalar, vector, or tensorial
- keep units and sign conventions explicit in the file, not only in narrative text
- distinguish direct DFT evidence from empirical calibration steps
- state clearly what the continuum model must assume for the handoff to remain valid

## Frequent Failure Modes

- handing off raw DFT numbers with no interpretation, units, or basis notes
- using one crystalline orientation as though it represented an isotropic bulk automatically
- mixing intrinsic and effective properties without saying so
- ignoring the operating window, then reusing the parameter outside its valid regime
- treating reaction energies or barriers as if they were already a complete rate law

## Escalate Or Pair With

- pair with the property-specific upstream case that actually generates the constitutive input, such as mechanics, optics, migration, interface, or plasma cases
- pair with `13-lammps-coupling-and-mlff-handoff.md` when mesoscale parameters must first be generated from larger-scale atomistic sampling
- pair with `10-chemical-reaction-pathway-screening.md` when a reduced reaction network must be derived before handoff
- pair with `16-phonon-and-thermal-transport.md` if thermal constitutive inputs depend on vibrational calculations

## Deliverables

- parameter-requirement sheet tied to the downstream model
- COMSOL-ready handoff table with traceable provenance
- validity-window and uncertainty note
- explicit boundary statement on what continuum assumptions sit outside the DFT layer
